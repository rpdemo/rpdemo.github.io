The Story
---------

A friend and I were just ‘hmm’ing in Facebook messages and then out of the blue (yeah, let’s make it more dramatic!) she wrote ‘hmm’ on my wall. I thought this is now going to escalate. I thought of automating my ‘hmm’ comments and quickly switched on my laptop. While i was manually ‘hmm’ing, I wrote a python script to comment ‘hmm’ every 1 min and executed it.

Few other friends joined in and I saw my script doing its magic. I made an improvement – the script would comment only if someone else had commented.

In all,  it was very fun. I felt like I was working on a deadline. :P

The Apology
------------
Dear friends, sorry for trolling you but all of it was for the sake of computer science. _/\\_
